# NumericalPythonRobertJohansson

This repository consists of my test and summary python notebooks, 
covering the numerical python practical techniques as taught by Robert Johansson. Making these notebooks helped me to understand the techniques taught therein as I customize the notebooks to my liking.

There are probably some new things to learn here through my additions and mistakes. Otherwise, I recommend that you check Robert Johansson's original book and python notebooks. You may follow this link: http://www.apress.com/9781484205549
